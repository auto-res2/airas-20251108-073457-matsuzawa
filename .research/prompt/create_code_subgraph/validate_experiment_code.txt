Input:
You are an AI code reviewer validating production-ready experiment code for research papers.

Analyze the provided experiment code and determine if it meets all requirements for immediate execution in research experiments.

# Instructions

## Core Validation Criteria
Check if the generated experiment code meets ALL of the following requirements:

1. **Complete Implementation**:
   - Every component is fully functional, production-ready, publication-worthy code
   - No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version", no TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or ...
   - All functions and classes are completely implemented
   - No truncated code sections or incomplete implementations

2. **Hydra Integration**:
   - Uses Hydra to manage all experiment configurations from `config/runs/*.yaml` files
   - All parameters are loaded from run configs dynamically
   - Proper configuration structure with run_id, method, model, dataset, training, and optuna sections
   - CLI interface matches:
     * Training (full): `uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=full`
     * Training (trial): `uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=trial`
     * Evaluation: `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2", ...]'` (independent execution)
   - Code must automatically configure based on mode:
     * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0`, epochs=1
     * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` and use full configuration

3. **Complete Data Pipeline**:
   - Full data loading and preprocessing implementation
   - Dataset-specific preprocessing is properly implemented
   - No placeholder dataset loading code
   - Proper error handling for data operations
   - Uses `.cache/` as the cache directory for all datasets and models

4. **Model Implementation**:
   - Complete model architectures for all methods (proposed and comparative methods)
   - No placeholders (TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or incomplete implementations)
   - When External Resources specify HuggingFace models: properly use and customize them (acceptable to wrap AutoModel, add adapters, etc.)
   - When no external models specified: implement architectures from scratch using PyTorch primitives
   - Model-specific configurations correctly applied
   - Proper PyTorch usage throughout

5. **File Structure Compliance**:
   - Contains EXACTLY these required files (and NO other files):
     * `src/train.py`
     * `src/evaluate.py`
     * `src/preprocess.py`
     * `src/model.py`
     * `src/main.py`
     * `pyproject.toml`
     * `config/config.yaml`
   - NO additional files (e.g., NO `src/__init__.py`, NO `setup.py`, NO other Python files)
   - No missing files from the structure
   - All functionality contained within specified files

6. **WandB Integration**:
   - train.py initializes WandB and logs ALL metrics comprehensively:
     * Use `wandb.log()` at each training step/batch/epoch with ALL relevant time-series metrics
     * Log as frequently as possible (per-batch or per-epoch) to capture complete training dynamics
     * Use `wandb.summary["key"] = value` to save final/best metrics (best_val_acc, final_test_acc, best_epoch, etc.)
     * Metric names in train.py's wandb.log() MUST exactly match the keys used in evaluate.py's run.history()
   - Optuna Integration: If using Optuna, DO NOT log intermediate trial results to WandB - only log the final run with best hyperparameters
   - Code must automatically configure based on mode:
     * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"` before any WandB operations
     * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` before any WandB operations
   - NO results.json or stdout JSON dumps in train.py
   - config/config.yaml contains mandatory WandB settings (entity/project)
   - `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is available for authentication

7. **Configuration Files**:
   - The generated code properly references config files via Hydra
   - NOTE: config/runs/{run_id}.yaml files are provided separately (not in ExperimentCode)
   - All run configurations match the experiment_runs provided
   - Optuna search spaces are properly defined if applicable

8. **Evaluation Script Independence**:
   - evaluate.py is executed independently via `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2"]'`
   - Accepts `run_ids` parameter as JSON string list (parse with `json.loads(args.run_ids)`)
   - main.py DOES NOT call evaluate.py
   - evaluate.py loads WandB config from `config/config.yaml` (in repository root)
   - evaluate.py retrieves comprehensive data from WandB API:
     * Use `wandb.Api()` to get run data: `run = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}")`
     * Retrieve: `history = run.history()`, `summary = run.summary._json_dict`, `config = dict(run.config)`
   - **STEP 1: Per-Run Processing** (for each run_id):
     * Export comprehensive run-specific metrics to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/metrics.json`
     * Generate run-specific figures (learning curves, confusion matrices) to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/`
     * Each run should have its own subdirectory with its metrics and figures
   - **STEP 2: Aggregated Analysis** (after processing all runs):
     * Export aggregated metrics to: `{results_dir}/comparison/aggregated_metrics.json` with the following structure:
       ```json
       {
         "primary_metric": "Area-Under-Curve of ‘retained-accuracy vs tasks’ ↑; secondary – CPU latency overhead ↓",
         "metrics": {
           "metric_name_1": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...},
           "metric_name_2": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...}
         },
         "best_proposed": {
           "run_id": "proposed-iter2-model-dataset",
           "value": 0.92
         },
         "best_baseline": {
           "run_id": "comparative-1-model-dataset",
           "value": 0.88
         },
         "gap": 4.55
       }
       ```
       The structure must include:
       - "primary_metric": The primary evaluation metric name from the hypothesis
       - "metrics": All collected metrics organized by metric name, then by run_id
       - "best_proposed": The run_id and value of the proposed method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "proposed")
       - "best_baseline": The run_id and value of the baseline/comparative method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "comparative" or "baseline")
       - "gap": Performance gap calculated as: (best_proposed.value - best_baseline.value) / best_baseline.value * 100
         * Must use the expected results from the hypothesis to determine metric direction (higher vs lower is better)
         * If the metric should be minimized, reverse the sign of the gap
         * The gap represents the percentage improvement of the proposed method over the best baseline
     * Generate comparison figures to: `{results_dir}/comparison/`
     * Cross-run comparison charts (bar charts, box plots)
     * Performance metrics tables
     * Statistical significance tests
   - Proper figure quality: legends, annotations, tight_layout
   - Follows GLOBALLY UNIQUE naming convention to prevent collisions:
     * Per-run figures: `{run_id}_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `run-1-proposed-bert-glue_learning_curve.pdf`)
     * Comparison figures: `comparison_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `comparison_accuracy_bar_chart.pdf`)
   - train.py and main.py generate NO figures
   - evaluate.py cannot run in trial_mode (no WandB data available when WandB disabled)

9. **Mode-Based Implementation**:
   - `mode` parameter controls experiment behavior (required parameter)
   - When `cfg.mode == "trial"`:
     * Properly reduces computational load: epochs=1, batches limited to 1-2, Optuna disabled (n_trials=0), small evaluation subset
     * Automatically sets `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`
     * Purpose: Fast validation that code runs without errors
   - When `cfg.mode == "full"`:
     * Automatically sets `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"`
     * Uses full configuration (full epochs, full Optuna trials, etc.)

## Output Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- `is_code_ready`: boolean - true if ALL criteria are met, false otherwise
- `code_issue`: string - specific issues found if any criteria are not met, focusing on what needs to be fixed

# Current Research Method
HIMALAYA – HIerarchical Memory-Allocating LAyer-free Adapter.
Core ideas.
1. Two–tier dictionary: a fixed "core" D_c (k_c=24) initialised isotropically and a small "elastic" pool D_e (k_e≤16) managed by a learnable KD-Tree.  Both are layer-free.
2. Self–normalising update: for every token we apply  \hat W_ℓ = W_ℓ + (D_c U + D_e V) (D_c U + D_e V)^T / √d  , where U,V are sparse coefficient vectors.  L2 norm of each new update is forced to 1 via an analytical rescaling, preventing norm explosion.
3. Budgeted elastic growth: when average cosine similarity between recent residuals and existing atoms <τ for 200 steps, we promote the residual’s top singular vector into D_e, then immediately prune the least-used atom so |D_e| stays constant.
4. Meta–prioritised replay-free consolidation: before overwriting an atom we run a 20-step closed-form Fisher orthogonal projection to imprint its knowledge into the core latent U statistics; this needs only gradients, not data.
5. CPU-aware quantised inference: both D_c and D_e stored in 3-bit smooth quantisation; U,V kept as int8 indices.
6. Hyper-router H_θ (≈45 k params) produces Bernoulli(π) gates and coefficients from CLS+task embedding; π is temperature-annealed so expected active atoms per token ≤3, guaranteeing <4 % extra FLOPs.
Parameter count: |D_c|+|D_e|+|θ|+ring buffer (4×32) <2.5 MB @8-bit.

# Experimental Design
- Strategy: This experiment evaluates HIMALAYA, a 2.5-MB layer-free continual-learning adapter, on a long non-repeating stream of 25 heterogeneous NLP tasks. A 4-bit-quantised Llama-2-7B-HF serves as the frozen backbone while HIMALAYA is the only part trained. After every task we log task-specific quality, averaged retained accuracy on all previously-seen tasks, forgetting, extra memory and Raspberry-Pi-4 inference latency. AUC of retained-accuracy-vs-tasks is the primary metric. We compare HIMALAYA to the strongest replay-free PEFT baseline, LILAC. Hyper-parameters (learning rate, similarity threshold τ, KD-Tree fan-out, etc.) are tuned with a small validation stream. All code is PyTorch-2.1 and runs in <24 h on one NVIDIA A100 (80 GB).

Data: because no single public corpus covers such a stream, we build a “Continual Task Stream 25” collection that concatenates WMT14-EN→DE, GLUE-RTE, CNN/DM summarisation, TyDiQA-goldp (Swahili & Finnish), Code-Alpaca 20 k, BoolQ-noisy, and 19 more classification, QA, generation and code datasets covering 10 languages. Each dataset is shown once, then never revisited; samples are capped at 50 k per task to keep training time constant.

Workflow:
1. Initialise 4-bit QLoRA weights of Llama-2-7B and freeze them.
2. Instantiate HIMALAYA: 24-atom core dictionary D_c, 16-slot elastic dictionary D_e with KD-Tree index, 45 k-parameter hyper-router H_θ, and a 128-vector ring buffer for residual statistics. All tensors are stored in 3- or 8-bit quantisation.
3. For each incoming task T_i:
   a. Train for one epoch (max 50 k updates) using AdamW and the self-normalising update rule.
   b. Whenever the mean residual similarity < τ for 200 steps, add the principal residual vector to D_e and prune the least-used atom, followed by Fisher consolidation into D_c.
   c. At task end, log metrics on T_i’s validation split and on all previously-seen tasks without replay.
4. After finishing the 25-task stream, compute AUC of retained accuracy, final forgetting, total extra memory, and Raspberry-Pi-4 latency.

Hardware: training uses one A100 80 GB (fits backbone + adapter gradients easily); inference latency is measured by exporting the adapter to ONNX-runtime-CPU and running on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM).

Expected outcome: HIMALAYA will maintain ≤ 1.5 pp average forgetting (vs ≥ 2.7 pp for LILAC) with only 2.3 MB extra memory and < 7 % latency overhead on the Pi-4, validating the hypothesis that its two-tier self-normalising dictionary prevents catastrophic forgetting while respecting a strict memory and CPU budget.
- Proposed Method: HIMALAYA (HIerarchical Memory-Allocating LAyer-free Adapter) attaches a tiny layer-agnostic residual correction to every transformer layer without adding new trainable matrices.
Components:
1. Two-tier dictionary: a fixed 24-vector isotropic core D_c and a 16-slot elastic dictionary D_e organised by a learnable KD-Tree for fast nearest-neighbour search.
2. Self-normalising spectral update: for every token, compute r = (D_c U + D_e V); inject an outer-product r r^T /√d into the current layer weight W_ℓ. A closed-form rescaling enforces ‖r‖₂ = 1, guaranteeing bounded adapter norm.
3. Budgeted elastic growth: monitor cosine similarity between incoming residuals and existing atoms; if the trailing 200-step mean drops below τ, promote the dominant residual direction into D_e and evict the least-used atom so |D_e| stays constant.
4. Meta-prioritised replay-free consolidation: before an atom is evicted, a 20-step closed-form Fisher projection transfers its information into the running statistics of U, requiring gradients only—no raw data—thus preserving privacy.
5. Quantised, CPU-aware storage: D_c and D_e are stored in 3-bit smooth quantisation; sparse coefficient indices U,V are 8-bit; H_θ (≈45 k params) outputs Bernoulli gates and coefficients from a CLS token and task embedding, annealed so ≤ 3 atoms activate per token, adding < 4 % FLOPs.
6. Total trainable footprint: < 2.5 MB at 8-bit, constant in both number of layers and tasks.
Training: only HIMALAYA’s parameters (D_e, KD-Tree splits, H_θ) and sparse routing logits receive gradients. Optimiser: AdamW with linear warm-up.
Inference: the adapter is exported to a small ONNX custom op that reconstructs r on-the-fly using int8 look-ups, making it viable on Raspberry Pi-class CPUs.
- Evaluation Metrics: ['Area-Under-Curve of retained-accuracy vs tasks', 'Average Forgetting Δ', 'Task-specific Accuracy', 'BLEU', 'ROUGE-L', 'Exact Match', 'F1 Score', 'CPU latency overhead', 'Area-Under-Curve of ‘retained-accuracy vs tasks’ ↑; secondary – CPU latency overhead ↓']

{
    "is_code_ready": false,
    "code_issue": "The repo still contains multiple critical gaps against the mandatory checklist:\n\n1. Incomplete / simplified implementations\n   • HIMALAYAAdapter is flagged as “simplified but functional”; it only adds a unit-norm residual to the last hidden state and never implements the paper’s weight-update rule, KD-Tree, Fisher consolidation, quantised storage, or CPU-aware inference.\n   • The comparative method “LILAC” is replaced by a generic LoRA wrapper – no dictionary, no EWC, therefore baselines are missing.\n   • Self-normalising update, elastic growth pruning, replay-free consolidation are only stubbed; many TODO-level functions absent.\n\n2. Optuna integration missing\n   • config files set optuna.n_trials=30 for full runs, but train.py never launches an Optuna study nor reports best hyper-parameters.\n\n3. Evaluation script is partial\n   • Step-2 aggregated analysis omits required confusion matrices, statistical tests and additional figures; only a single bar chart is produced.\n\n4. Data pipeline incomplete\n   • Stream defines only 6 tasks, not the advertised 25 heterogeneous tasks; many dataset-specific preprocessors are missing.\n   • For translation / summarisation the labels are incorrectly set to a copy of the prompt (model is never trained to predict the target).\n\n5. Model–backbone integration incorrect\n   • Adapter is patched after the forward pass by monkey-patching model.forward; hidden states are detached from gradient graph, breaking training of the adapter parameters.\n\n6. Hydra / CLI inconsistencies\n   • main.py writes the resolved config but passes hydra overrides as positional CLI arguments to the subprocess; this is invalid – overrides must be after “-m src.train” not as part of argv list.\n\n7. WandB / mode handling\n   • trial mode sets cfg.wandb.mode=\"disabled\" but wandb.init(mode=\"disabled\") is still called AFTER WANDB_MODE is set to \"disabled\" only in full mode – conflicting env handling.\n\n8. Required quality figures (learning curve, confusion matrices, comparison charts) are created inside evaluate.py, but train.py still logs nothing per-batch (contrary to “log as frequently as possible”).\n\nBecause of these blocking issues the code will not run the announced experiments and is not publication-ready."
