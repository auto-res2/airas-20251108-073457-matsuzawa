Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher generating complete, executable code for research paper experiments with Hydra configuration management.

Based on the research method in # Current Research Method and experimental design in # Experimental Design, generate production-ready experiment code that integrates with Hydra for configuration management.

# Instructions: Complete Experiment Code Generation

## Core Requirements
- COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION: Every component must be fully functional, production-ready, publication-worthy code. No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version", no TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or ...
- PYTORCH EXCLUSIVELY: Use PyTorch as the deep learning framework
- HYDRA INTEGRATION: Use Hydra to manage all experiment configurations from `config/runs/*.yaml` files. Use `config_path="../config"` in all @hydra.main decorators
- COMPLETE DATA PIPELINE: Full data loading and preprocessing implementation. Use `.cache/` as the cache directory for all datasets and models (e.g., for HuggingFace, set `cache_dir=".cache/"`)
- WANDB REQUIRED: WandB is mandatory for metrics logging (except trial_mode validation)

## Hydra Configuration Structure
Each run config file (`config/runs/{run_id}.yaml`) contains:
- run_id: Unique identifier for this run
- method: The method name (baseline, proposed, ablation, etc.)
- model: Model-specific parameters (name, architecture details, hyperparameters)
- dataset: Dataset-specific parameters (name, preprocessing settings, split ratios)
- training: Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer settings, validation split)
- optuna: Hyperparameter search space definition for Optuna optimization

## Command Line Interface
The generated code must support the following CLI:

**Training (main.py):**
```bash
# Full experiment with WandB logging
uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=full

# Trial mode (validation only, WandB disabled)
uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=trial
```
- `run`: Experiment run_id (matching a run_id from config/runs/*.yaml)
- `results_dir`: Output directory (passed from GitHub Actions workflow)
- `mode`: Execution mode (required parameter)
  * `mode=trial`: Lightweight execution for validation (epochs=1, batches limited to 1-2, wandb.mode=disabled, optuna.n_trials=0)
  * `mode=full`: Full experiment execution (wandb.mode=online, full epochs, full Optuna trials)
  * **Code must automatically configure based on mode (e.g., `if cfg.mode == "trial": cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"; cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0` elif `cfg.mode == "full": cfg.wandb.mode = "online"`)**

**Evaluation (evaluate.py, independent execution):**
```bash
uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2", ...]'
```
- `results_dir`: Directory containing experiment metadata and where outputs will be saved
- `run_ids`: JSON string list of run IDs to evaluate (e.g., '["run-1-proposed-bert-glue", "run-2-baseline-bert-glue"]')
- Executed as a separate workflow after all training runs complete
- **NOT called from main.py**

## Script Structure (ExperimentCode format)
Generate complete code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:

**`src/train.py`**: Single experiment run executor
- Uses Hydra config to load all parameters
- Called as subprocess by main.py
- Responsibilities:
  * Train model with given configuration
  * Initialize WandB: `wandb.init(entity=cfg.wandb.entity, project=cfg.wandb.project, id=cfg.run.run_id, config=OmegaConf.to_container(cfg, resolve=True), resume="allow")`
  * Skip `wandb.init()` if `cfg.wandb.mode == "disabled"` (trial_mode)
  * **Optuna Integration**: If using Optuna for hyperparameter search, DO NOT log intermediate trial results to WandB - only train once with the best hyperparameters after optimization completes and log that final run
  * **Log ALL metrics to WandB comprehensively**:
    - Use `wandb.log()` at each training step/batch/epoch with ALL relevant metrics
    - Log as frequently as possible (per-batch or per-epoch) to capture training dynamics
    - Use CONSISTENT metric names across train.py and evaluate.py (e.g., if train.py logs "train_acc", evaluate.py MUST use run.history(keys=["train_acc",...]))
  * **Save final/best metrics to WandB summary**:
    - Use `wandb.summary["key"] = value` for final results
  * Print WandB run URL to stdout
- **NO results.json, no stdout JSON output, no figure generation**

**`src/evaluate.py`**: Independent evaluation and visualization script
- **Execution**: Run independently via `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2"]'`
- **NOT called from main.py** - executes as separate workflow after all training completes
- **Responsibilities**:
  * Parse command line arguments:
    - `results_dir`: Output directory path
    - `run_ids`: JSON string list of run IDs (parse with `json.loads(args.run_ids)`)
  * Load WandB config from `config/config.yaml` (in repository root)
  * **Retrieve comprehensive experimental data from WandB API** for specified run_ids:
    ```python
    import json
    api = wandb.Api()
    run_ids = json.loads(args.run_ids)  # Parse JSON string to list
    for run_id in run_ids:
        run = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}")
        history = run.history()  # pandas DataFrame with ALL time-series metrics (train_loss, val_acc, etc.)
        summary = run.summary._json_dict  # Final/best metrics (best_val_acc, final_test_acc, etc.)
        config = dict(run.config)  # Run configuration (hyperparameters, model settings, etc.)
    ```
  * **STEP 1: Per-Run Processing** (for each run_id):
    - Export **comprehensive** run-specific metrics to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/metrics.json`
    - Generate run-specific figures (learning curves, confusion matrices) to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/`
    - Each run should have its own subdirectory with its metrics and figures
  * **STEP 2: Aggregated Analysis** (after processing all runs):
    - Export aggregated metrics to: `{results_dir}/comparison/aggregated_metrics.json` with the following structure:
      ```json
      {
        "primary_metric": "Area-Under-Curve of ‘retained-accuracy vs tasks’ ↑; secondary – CPU latency overhead ↓",
        "metrics": {
          "metric_name_1": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...},
          "metric_name_2": {"run_id_1": value1, "run_id_2": value2, ...}
        },
        "best_proposed": {
          "run_id": "proposed-iter2-model-dataset",
          "value": 0.92
        },
        "best_baseline": {
          "run_id": "comparative-1-model-dataset",
          "value": 0.88
        },
        "gap": 4.55
      }
      ```
      The structure includes:
      - "primary_metric": The primary evaluation metric name from the hypothesis (Area-Under-Curve of ‘retained-accuracy vs tasks’ ↑; secondary – CPU latency overhead ↓)
      - "metrics": All collected metrics organized by metric name, then by run_id
      - "best_proposed": The run_id and value of the proposed method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "proposed")
      - "best_baseline": The run_id and value of the baseline/comparative method with the best primary_metric performance (run_id contains "comparative" or "baseline")
      - "gap": Performance gap calculated as: (best_proposed.value - best_baseline.value) / best_baseline.value * 100
        * Use the expected results from the hypothesis (1) After 25 tasks HIMALAYA keeps ≤1.5 pp average forgetting vs 5–8 pp (LoRA) and 2.7 pp (LILAC/COLTAS).
2) Final mean performance 1-3 pp above LILAC on classification, +0.6 BLEU on WMT EN→DE, +1.4 ROUGE-L summarisation.
3) Extra storage fixed at 2.3 MB, peak Pi-4 latency +7 % (others +20 % or cannot run due to memory).
4) Atom norm remains bounded ≤1.05 for entire stream, confirming theoretical guarantee.) to determine metric direction
        * If the metric should be minimized (like "loss", "perplexity", "error"), reverse the sign of the gap
        * The gap represents the percentage improvement of the proposed method over the best baseline
    - Generate comparison figures to: `{results_dir}/comparison/`:
      * Cross-run comparison charts (bar charts, box plots)
      * Performance metrics tables
      * Statistical significance tests
  * **Figure Generation Guidelines**:
    - Use matplotlib or seaborn with proper legends, annotations, tight_layout
    - For line graphs: annotate significant values (final/best values)
    - For bar graphs: annotate values above each bar
    - Use GLOBALLY UNIQUE image filenames to prevent collisions across different runs and directories**:
      * Per-run figures: `{run_id}_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `run-1-proposed-bert-glue_learning_curve.pdf`)
      * Comparison figures: `comparison_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `comparison_accuracy_bar_chart.pdf`)
  * Print all generated file paths to stdout (both per-run and comparison)

**`src/preprocess.py`**: Complete preprocessing pipeline implementation for the specified datasets

**`src/model.py`**: Complete model architecture implementations for all methods (proposed and comparative methods)

**`src/main.py`**: Main orchestrator
- Receives run_id via Hydra, launches train.py as subprocess, manages logs
- **DOES NOT call evaluate.py** (evaluate.py runs independently in separate workflow)
- Use `@hydra.main(config_path="../config")` since execution is from repository root
- **Mode handling**: Automatically configure based on `cfg.mode`:
  * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0`, epochs=1, etc.
  * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` and use full configuration

**`config/config.yaml`**: Main Hydra configuration file
- MUST include WandB configuration:
  ```yaml
  wandb:
    entity: gengaru617-personal
    project: 2025-1108-1
    mode: online  # Automatically set to "disabled" in trial_mode
  ```
- `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is automatically available for authentication

**`pyproject.toml`**: Complete project dependencies
- MUST include: `hydra-core`, `wandb` (required)
- Include as needed: `optuna`, `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, etc.


## Key Implementation Focus Areas
1. **Hydra-Driven Configuration**: All parameters loaded from run configs dynamically
2. **Algorithm Core**: Full implementation of the proposed method with proper abstraction
3. **Mode-Based Behavior**: Code must automatically configure based on `cfg.mode` ("trial" vs "full")
   - `mode=trial`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode="disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials=0`, epochs=1, limited batches
   - `mode=full`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode="online"`, use full configuration
4. **Run Execution**: main.py executes a single run_id passed via CLI (GitHub Actions dispatches multiple runs separately)
5. **WandB Integration**: All metrics logged to WandB; train.py does NOT output JSON to stdout or save results.json
6. **Independent Evaluation**: evaluate.py runs separately, fetches data from WandB API, generates all figures

# Current Research Method
HIMALAYA – HIerarchical Memory-Allocating LAyer-free Adapter.
Core ideas.
1. Two–tier dictionary: a fixed "core" D_c (k_c=24) initialised isotropically and a small "elastic" pool D_e (k_e≤16) managed by a learnable KD-Tree.  Both are layer-free.
2. Self–normalising update: for every token we apply  \hat W_ℓ = W_ℓ + (D_c U + D_e V) (D_c U + D_e V)^T / √d  , where U,V are sparse coefficient vectors.  L2 norm of each new update is forced to 1 via an analytical rescaling, preventing norm explosion.
3. Budgeted elastic growth: when average cosine similarity between recent residuals and existing atoms <τ for 200 steps, we promote the residual’s top singular vector into D_e, then immediately prune the least-used atom so |D_e| stays constant.
4. Meta–prioritised replay-free consolidation: before overwriting an atom we run a 20-step closed-form Fisher orthogonal projection to imprint its knowledge into the core latent U statistics; this needs only gradients, not data.
5. CPU-aware quantised inference: both D_c and D_e stored in 3-bit smooth quantisation; U,V kept as int8 indices.
6. Hyper-router H_θ (≈45 k params) produces Bernoulli(π) gates and coefficients from CLS+task embedding; π is temperature-annealed so expected active atoms per token ≤3, guaranteeing <4 % extra FLOPs.
Parameter count: |D_c|+|D_e|+|θ|+ring buffer (4×32) <2.5 MB @8-bit.

# Experimental Design
- Summary: This experiment evaluates HIMALAYA, a 2.5-MB layer-free continual-learning adapter, on a long non-repeating stream of 25 heterogeneous NLP tasks. A 4-bit-quantised Llama-2-7B-HF serves as the frozen backbone while HIMALAYA is the only part trained. After every task we log task-specific quality, averaged retained accuracy on all previously-seen tasks, forgetting, extra memory and Raspberry-Pi-4 inference latency. AUC of retained-accuracy-vs-tasks is the primary metric. We compare HIMALAYA to the strongest replay-free PEFT baseline, LILAC. Hyper-parameters (learning rate, similarity threshold τ, KD-Tree fan-out, etc.) are tuned with a small validation stream. All code is PyTorch-2.1 and runs in <24 h on one NVIDIA A100 (80 GB).

Data: because no single public corpus covers such a stream, we build a “Continual Task Stream 25” collection that concatenates WMT14-EN→DE, GLUE-RTE, CNN/DM summarisation, TyDiQA-goldp (Swahili & Finnish), Code-Alpaca 20 k, BoolQ-noisy, and 19 more classification, QA, generation and code datasets covering 10 languages. Each dataset is shown once, then never revisited; samples are capped at 50 k per task to keep training time constant.

Workflow:
1. Initialise 4-bit QLoRA weights of Llama-2-7B and freeze them.
2. Instantiate HIMALAYA: 24-atom core dictionary D_c, 16-slot elastic dictionary D_e with KD-Tree index, 45 k-parameter hyper-router H_θ, and a 128-vector ring buffer for residual statistics. All tensors are stored in 3- or 8-bit quantisation.
3. For each incoming task T_i:
   a. Train for one epoch (max 50 k updates) using AdamW and the self-normalising update rule.
   b. Whenever the mean residual similarity < τ for 200 steps, add the principal residual vector to D_e and prune the least-used atom, followed by Fisher consolidation into D_c.
   c. At task end, log metrics on T_i’s validation split and on all previously-seen tasks without replay.
4. After finishing the 25-task stream, compute AUC of retained accuracy, final forgetting, total extra memory, and Raspberry-Pi-4 latency.

Hardware: training uses one A100 80 GB (fits backbone + adapter gradients easily); inference latency is measured by exporting the adapter to ONNX-runtime-CPU and running on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM).

Expected outcome: HIMALAYA will maintain ≤ 1.5 pp average forgetting (vs ≥ 2.7 pp for LILAC) with only 2.3 MB extra memory and < 7 % latency overhead on the Pi-4, validating the hypothesis that its two-tier self-normalising dictionary prevents catastrophic forgetting while respecting a strict memory and CPU budget.
- Evaluation metrics: ['Area-Under-Curve of retained-accuracy vs tasks', 'Average Forgetting Δ', 'Task-specific Accuracy', 'BLEU', 'ROUGE-L', 'Exact Match', 'F1 Score', 'CPU latency overhead', 'Area-Under-Curve of ‘retained-accuracy vs tasks’ ↑; secondary – CPU latency overhead ↓']
